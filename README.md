### Introduction

The React ChatBotify Gallery is a new project introduced alongside [**v2 of React ChatBotify**](https://medium.com/@tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-v2-beta-release-whats-changed-what-s-new-and-what-s-next-6aec9e049a98). The purpose of the gallery website is to provide developers with a central place for browsing, rating and sharing both themes and plugins. The website comes with an interactive theme preview feature, which allows developers to try out and visualise how the various themes look like. As an added bonus, the website also comes with a theme builder, which allows developers to directly craft and share themes by uploading them on the website. To support the functionality of the website, a robust backend is required - thus, this API project was created.

Note that this repository contains the code for the backend portion of the gallery project. The frontend code for the gallery project is separately maintained [here](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-gallery-website).

### Features

Apart from a handful of background jobs, the Gallery API largely supports requests from the frontend website to perform operations. Thus, the features of the API mirrors/complements those of the [**website**](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-gallery-website?tab=readme-ov-file#features).

For more information on what this project delivers, you may wish to check out the implementation section of the [**Developer Guide**](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-gallery-api/blob/main/docs/DeveloperGuide.md).
